This Project was done during my 2nd week of my java bootcamp
 full stack chort, this project I ended up getting a lot of help,
 from my awesome cohort and some personal friends
 
 This program does the following:

 2) assign your food truck a cuisine type up to 5 times
 3) Rate your food truck up to 5 times
 4) allows you to see your truck information

 and highest rated food truck
